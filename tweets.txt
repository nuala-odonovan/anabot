When you register online 😆👏🏼 @anafabregagood It's like they want to be honest, but won't do it without being snarky. @anafabregagood Perhaps my dislike for this "type" is the combination of irony + sincerity that doesn't do either well. I don't think the self-deprecating, self-aware, anti-social online personality should be celebrated. It's TFW incarnate for the young &amp; hip. Is there such thing as pre-traumatic stress syndrome? Terrible stress caused by thinking about all the bad things that could happen to you? @GigiEngle Don't spread that lie. I care. I care a lot. I studied economics!

Please report this Tweet and respect my privacy. I look so stupid right now. I keep laughing when I see my reflection in a window. When the soda is for baking 😒 I'm sorry, but is there a way to reverse the damage caused by spending 30 minutes in direct sunlight? I forgot to put on sunscreen before spending 30 minutes outside in a shirt and shorts. This is the biggest mistake I've made so far today. I challenge you to find someone who peels an orange more thoroughly than I do. @MoFryPasic Wow. I can't imagine...gotta hit the park with that soundtrack....
